    "text": "History of Machine Learning\nArtificial intelligence gave birth to machine learning in the early 1950s and 1960s where researchers explored the idea of “teaching” machines to learn from experience.\nIn the 1950s, the term “thinking machine” was often used to describe a hypothetical device that could perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Alan Turing is one of the persons behind the foundation in the development of thinking machines, he was a mathematician and scientist.\nIn 1956 a conference held at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA called Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The conference was organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, who are often referred to as the “founding fathers of artificial intelligence. During the conference, the researchers proposed the creation of a machine that could learn from experience, reason, and understand natural language. This proposal became known as the Dartmouth proposal and was here that the term artificial intelligence was coined.\nThe period between 1956 and 1974 is often referred to as “the golden years” Research was well funded by government agencies, Technological advancements were made in computation and algorithms, Space exploration and prototypes of intelligent machines were built. Some of these machines include:\n\nShakey the robot: A robot who could maneuver and decide how to perform tasks intelligently\n\n\n\n\nShakey the robot\n\n\n\nEliza: an early chatterbot, could converse with people and act as a primitive therapist. Eliza remains a popular and influential program, and it has inspired many other chatbots and virtual assistants over the years.\n\n\n\n\nEliza 1996\n\n\nThese are some prototypes of intelligent machines were built between 1956 and 1974."

    "section": "AI Winter",
    "text": "AI Winter\nThe period between 1974–1980 was the time of reduced funding and interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Funding dried up and confidence in the field slowed. Some issues that impacted confidence included:\n\nLimitations. Compute power was too limited\nCombinatorial explosion. The amount of parameters needed to be trained grew exponentially as more was asked of computers, without a parallel evolution of compute power and capability.\nPaucity of data. There was a paucity of data that hindered the process of testing, developing, and refining algorithms.\n\nAdditionally, there were concerns about the ethical implications of AI, particularly in the areas of automation and job displacement. This led to public skepticism and fear about the potential negative impacts of AI on society. Despite these challenges, AI research continued to advance during the AI winter, and the field experienced a increase of interest and funding in the 1980s and 1990s."

    "text": "Techniques of Machine Learning\nTechniques of machine learning refer to the different methods and approaches used to train machine learning models to learn from data and make predictions. There many different techniques of machine learning some of them include: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning and many more:\nSupervised Learning: This is type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or classifications about new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include predicting the price of a house based on its features such as size and location, or classifying an email as spam or not spam based on its content.\n\n\n\nSupervised Learning\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning: This is type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on data without any supervision or labeled examples. Some popular unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and autoencoders.\n\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\n\nSemi-supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning technique that lies between supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, a labeled dataset is used to train a model, while in unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the model learns to find patterns and structures in the data. In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning has been successfully applied to various applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n\n\n\nSemi-supervised Learning"

    "text": "Alhamdulillah, I am excited to share my journey through the Arewa Data Science Fellowship, an enriching experience that ignited my passion for both technical and soft skills. This transformative journey has been marked by dedication, resilience, and unwavering commitment to growth.\nThe fellowship wasn’t solely about Data Science and Machine Learning; it was a full immersion into a realm where data-driven innovation converges with vital soft skills. From creating my personal blog post site using Quarto to mastering the art of managing and showcasing my abilities on GitHub, I learned to not just embrace my skills but to effectively market them.\nThe fellowship took us far beyond Data Science and Machine Learning boundaries. Amid the various courses on Coursera, two standout courses reshaped our approach to learning and academic writing: ‘Learning How to Learn’ and ‘Scientific Writing.’\nThe peak of this journey was my participation in the Cohere AI hackathon, where my team secured second position and a prize of eight hundred dollars. This achievement underscored the power of collaboration and the tangible outcomes that emerge from combining skillsets and ideas.\nThis journey was not without its challenges, but with guidance from exceptional mentors especially Dr. Shamsuddeen H Muhmmad, Dr. Idirs Abdulmumin, and Dr. Ibrahim Sa’id. I was empowered to overcome obstacles and surpass my own expectations. Their unwavering support and guidance were instrumental in shaping my perspective and propelling me forward.\nBefore joining the Arewa Data Science Fellowship, virtual classes were not my preferred mode of learning. However, this experience shifted my mindset entirely. The online platform seamlessly facilitated engagement, collaboration, and active learning, debunking any prior reservations I held.\nAs I reflect on my fellowship completion, I am not just celebrating the acquisition of new skills; I am celebrating a profound transformation that has redefined my capabilities and outlook. The Arewa Data Science Fellowship has empowered me to embrace change, adapt with agility, and thrive in a dynamic world.\nWith gratitude in my heart and a newfound zeal for continuous growth, I step into the future. The journey has been extraordinary, and the path ahead holds endless promise. Thank you, Arewa Data Science Academy, for being the catalyst of this remarkable journey."
